## Episode 3: The Wedding Invitation

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden hue across the small apartment shared by Jack and Emily. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of the blueberry muffins cooling on the kitchen counter. Jack leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest, a teasing smirk playing on his lips as Emily danced around the kitchen. 

“Did you really put more sugar in the muffins?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.

Emily spun around, flour dusting her apron like a badge of honor. “I’ll have you know, they are perfectly balanced. Sweet enough to win over even the grumpiest of boyfriends,” she shot back, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

“Grumpy? Me?” Jack chuckled, stepping inside the kitchen to snag a muffin from the cooling rack. He took a bite, eyes narrowing. “Okay, fine. They’re pretty good.”

She grinned, pleased with herself. But the moment was fleeting. The doorbell rang, cutting through their playful banter. 

“Who could that be?” Jack asked, wiping crumbs from his mouth.

“Beats me. Maybe it’s the muffin police.” She giggled, heading to the door.

As she opened it, the smile on her face faded, replaced by a flicker of confusion. In front of her stood Megan, Emily’s childhood friend and former college roommate, holding a bright envelope with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“Hey, Em! Sorry to just drop by like this. I hope I'm not interrupting anything...?” Megan’s voice trailed off, glancing between Jack and Emily.

Emily stepped aside, letting Megan in, while Jack’s expression hardened slightly. “No, not at all. Just baking,” Emily replied, forcing cheerfulness into her tone.

Megan settled into the living room, her hands fiddling with the envelope. “I have something for you,” she said, finally offering it to Emily. 

“What is it?” Emily asked, her curiosity piqued. She opened the envelope, her eyes scanning the contents. “Oh… it’s an invitation to Ben and Sarah’s wedding.”

Jack’s brows knitted together at the mention of Ben, Emily’s high school boyfriend. “That’s the guy who ghosted you right before prom, right?” he interjected, crossing his arms.

“Jack, it’s not that simple,” Emily said, shooting him a warning glance. 

“Oh, come on, Em. It’s been a decade. Why do you still care?” Jack’s voice was laced with sarcasm, but his expression held genuine concern.

“It’s not about ‘caring,’ Jack,” Emily snapped, her patience wearing thin. “Ben and I had a history, and I thought I had moved on, but…” She hesitated, biting her lip. “It’s just strange, okay?”

Megan looked between the two, sensing the tension rising like a tide. “You should go,” she suggested gently. “It might be good for you to see everyone again. You might even have fun!”

“Fun? At my ex-boyfriend’s wedding?” Emily laughed, but it held a bitter edge. “What about you, Jack? You wouldn’t mind me going, right?”

“Of course not,” Jack replied, yet the way he shifted his weight suggested otherwise. “It’s just… weddings can be weird. All those happy couples getting all lovey-dovey… it’s like a breeding ground for insecurities.”

Emily rolled her eyes, a familiar frustration bubbling beneath the surface. “You know it’s not like that. I love you, Jack. Why can’t you just trust that?”

“Because it’s been ten years, Em! And I still remember the way you looked at him back then,” Jack countered, a hint of vulnerability creeping into his tone.

“Jack, that was a lifetime ago!” she shot back, her voice rising. “If I wanted to be with Ben, I would have been with him. I chose you!”

“Yeah, well, sometimes I wonder if you’re still choosing me,” Jack murmured, the weight of his words hanging heavily in the air.

Silence enveloped the room, thick and suffocating. Emily felt a pang of guilt, realizing how their argument had escalated. She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just… this wedding is making me feel things I thought I had buried.”

Megan shifted in her seat, a silent witness to their emotional tug-of-war. “Why don’t we all go?” she suggested, attempting to lighten the mood. “Make it a fun day out. You know, group therapy style.”

Jack shot her a look that screamed ‘not helping,’ while Emily’s eyes sparkled at the notion. “That could be fun! We could make a day of it!” she exclaimed, her excitement returning.

“Or it could be a disaster,” Jack muttered, but the corners of his mouth twitched upwards, betraying his apprehension.

Emily reached for his hand, squeezing it tightly. “Come on. It’ll be fun. I promise.”

“Alright, alright,” Jack relented, giving in to her enthusiasm. “But if I have to listen to one more ‘happily ever after’ speech, I’m walking out.”

As the tension faded, Megan clapped her hands together. “Perfect! I’ll handle the logistics. Just promise me you’ll both dress up nice. I want some cute couple photos!”

Emily let out a laugh, her spirits lifting. “Deal! Just don’t make me wear those ridiculous matching outfits you used to love.”

Jack chuckled, “I’ll take my chances with the suit and tie. Don’t want to overshadow Ben’s big day, after all.”

The days leading up to the wedding were a whirlwind. Emily found herself caught in a flurry of emotions—excitement, anxiety, and a wave of nostalgia as she pulled out her old dress from the back of her closet. She could still remember the way she felt when she wore it to prom, the way Ben had looked at her with a mix of admiration and regret. 

“Do you really think I should wear this?” she asked Jack one evening as they sat on the couch, the dress hanging limply across her lap.

He studied her, a contemplative look on his face. “You look beautiful in it, but… it’s a bit… retro, don’t you think?”

“Retro? It’s classic!” Emily protested, a playful smile creeping onto her face. “Besides, it’s not like I’m trying to impress Ben. I just want to feel good about myself.”

“Then wear it,” Jack said softly, his gaze warming. “Just remember, I’m right here. No matter what happens.”

“Thanks, Jack,” she whispered, leaning in to give him a soft kiss.

The day of the wedding dawned bright and clear. Emily stood in front of the mirror, adjusting her hair, her heart racing with a mixture of excitement and dread. Jack entered the room, dressed sharply, his expression unreadable as he assessed her in the dress.

“You look stunning,” he said, his voice low.

“Thanks. You clean up pretty well yourself,” she replied, her nerves easing slightly.

“Ready for this?” he asked, looking genuinely concerned.

“Ready as I’ll ever be,” she said, a confident smile spreading across her face.

As they made their way to the venue, the car filled with a charged silence, the air thick with unsaid words. Emily’s mind raced with thoughts of Ben, of old wounds and lingering feelings. What if she found herself comparing their lives? What if she saw something in Ben that stirred feelings she thought were long gone?

“Hey, you okay?” Jack’s voice broke through her thoughts, pulling her back to the present.

“Yeah, just thinking,” she said, forcing a smile.

“About Ben?”

She paused, biting her lip. “A little. But mostly about us.”

“Us?” Jack’s brow furrowed. “What about us?”

“Just… everything,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I love you, but sometimes I feel like there’s so much we don’t say. Like we skirt around things instead of tackling them head-on.”

Jack nodded, his gaze steady on the road. “You’re right. Maybe this wedding will give us a chance to confront some of that.”

As they pulled into the venue, the sound of laughter and music wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. Emily’s heart pounded in her chest as they stepped out of the car, the reality of the day settling in.

Jack took her hand tightly, and together they walked towards the entrance. The moment they stepped inside, the atmosphere buzzed with joy, and the sight of familiar faces made Emily’s heart race. But among the smiling crowd, her eyes locked onto one familiar figure—Ben, standing at the altar, his gaze sweeping the room.

And just like that, the weight of the past crashed into the present.

“Jack…” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the music.

“Yeah?” he replied, his eyes scanning the crowd.

“I think… I think I need to talk to him,” Emily said, her heart pounding.

Jack’s grip on her hand tightened, a flash of concern crossing his face. “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”

“I don’t know,” she admitted, her resolve wavering. “But I need to know if I’ve really moved on.”

Before Jack could respond, Emily stepped forward, the crowd parting around her. She felt Jack’s presence behind her, a silent support, but the weight of her decision felt heavy in the air. 

As she approached Ben, a mix of emotions washed over her—fear, excitement, and a tinge of nostalgia. The moment felt surreal, as if time had rewound to a decade ago. 

“Emily?” Ben turned, surprise etched across his features.

“Hey, Ben,” she said, forcing a smile while her heart raced.

“Wow, you look… amazing,” he stammered, his eyes widening.

“Thanks. You too,” she replied, her voice steady despite the storm of feelings swirling within her.

In that moment, Emily could feel Jack’s presence, a steady anchor. But as she locked eyes with Ben, she realized that this encounter was not just about the past; it was about confronting the love and hate that had defined her relationship with Jack, and more importantly, herself.

The wedding continued around them, but all she could focus on was the man standing in front of her—the man from her past—and the uncertain future waiting to unfold.

“Can we talk?” she asked, her heart pounding as she stepped closer, the crowd fading into a blur.

Jack’s eyes darkened, a mix of concern and protectiveness as he watched her, but she felt the pull of the moment too strong to ignore. 

“Yeah, I’d like that,” Ben replied, his expression shifting from surprise to something deeper, something she hadn’t anticipated.

As they stepped to the side, the noise of the wedding fading into the background, Emily felt the weight of choices looming over her. Would she confront her past, or would she return to Jack, the man who loved her fiercely?

The tension crackled in the air as they faced each other, and Emily knew that this moment would change everything.

With the stakes higher than ever, Emily took a deep breath, ready to uncover the truth that could either bind her and Jack closer together or unravel everything they had built. 

And as she opened her mouth to speak, the world around them fell silent, holding its breath for what was to come.
