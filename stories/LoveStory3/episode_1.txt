**Episode 1: The Wedding Invitation**

The sun filtered through the sheer curtains of their living room, casting a warm golden glow over the scattered remnants of breakfast. Jack leaned against the kitchen counter, his tousled hair reflecting the morning light, while Emily stood by the sink, scrubbing the last of the dishes. The rhythmic sound of running water filled the space, punctuated by the occasional clink of silverware.

“Are you going to keep that up all morning?” Jack teased, a playful smirk stretching across his lips. “I could have sworn we were done when you tossed that last plate into the sink like it was a football.”

Emily shot him a mock glare, her hands still submerged in sudsy water. “Well, someone has to clean up after your ‘champion’ breakfast. I mean, who knew you could burn toast in a toaster?”

“Hey, I was multitasking!” He defended, crossing his arms. “I was trying to toast bread while also perfecting my omelet skills. It’s not my fault the toaster has a vendetta against me.”

“Right. Blame it on the toaster,” she chuckled, finally turning to face him, her dark curls bouncing slightly. “Next, you’ll be telling me the eggs were plotting against you too.”

“Exactly! You get it!” Jack laughed, the tension from the previous night’s argument dissipating like steam in the air. 

However, their lighthearted banter was interrupted by the sudden, shrill ring of Emily’s phone. She dried her hands hastily on a towel and glanced at the screen. It was a message notification from Julia, her best friend. Jack raised an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.

“Emergency?” he asked, leaning closer as she opened the message.

Emily’s face shifted as she read the text, her bright smile faltering. “Uh-oh. Julia’s getting married. She wants us to save the date for next month.”

Jack’s heart sank for a brief moment before curiosity took over. “That’s great news for her! But wait... where are they getting married?”

“Um, you know, that quaint little vineyard we went to last summer. The one with the—” 

“—the picturesque views and the overpriced wine?” Jack interjected, his face scrunching in mock distaste. “Yeah, I remember that.” 

“Right, that one.” Emily hesitated, her gaze dropping to the screen again. “Oh, and she added that she wants everyone to bring a plus one.” 

Jack’s expression turned quizzical. “And let me guess, your plus one is...?”

“Of course, it’s you!” She exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with a mix of excitement and apprehension. “Oh, come on! It’ll be fun. Just imagine it—a beautiful day, wine flowing, and dancing under the stars.”

“Dancing? You mean you dancing while I awkwardly twirl around like a wounded gazelle?” He chuckled, shaking his head. “I’ll pass.”

“Jack! You’re going to be my date. You can’t just bail on your girlfriend’s best friend’s wedding!” She placed the phone down and crossed her arms, feigning irritation, but the corners of her mouth twitched with suppressed laughter.

He feigned a sigh, a dramatic hand to his forehead. “Fine! But I’m wearing my best ‘wounded gazelle’ costume.”

“Oh, how generous of you!” she laughed, relief washing over her features. “But… about Julia’s fiancé…”

“What about him?” Jack asked, a note of wariness creeping into his voice.

“Um, he’s…well, you remember Derek, right? My ex?” 

Jack’s playful demeanor faded. “Oh. That Derek.”

“Yeah. He’s the one marrying her.” She fiddled with her ring, her brow furrowing as she watched Jack’s reaction.

“Right. I should have known. What are the odds?” Jack said, his tone suddenly serious. “Are you okay with that?”

Emily paused, biting her lip. “I mean, it’s been years. It’s not like I have feelings for him anymore. But… I don’t know. It might be a little weird.”

Jack turned away, running a hand through his hair, his expression unreadable. “Weird? Sure. That’s one way to put it.” 

“Jack, come on! It’s not like I’m still in love with him. You know that.” 

“Do I?” He shot back, his voice slightly sharper than intended. “Because it feels like it sometimes. I mean, you don’t exactly talk about him in the past tense. You call him ‘Derek’ like he’s still fresh in your mind.”

“Okay, that’s unfair! I haven’t thought about him in ages. You know how it is—you break up, you move on, and then you see them again, and it’s just… awkward!” 

“Awkward? Is that what we’re calling it?” Jack snapped, his playful banter replaced by frustration. “You’re acting like it’s no big deal, but it is a big deal. You’re going to be celebrating a wedding with your ex, and I’m supposed to sit there smiling while you reminisce about the good old days?”

“Stop making this about you!” Emily shot back, her voice rising. “This is about Julia! She deserves to be happy. Just because Derek is there doesn’t mean I have to interact with him!”

Jack huffed, turning away from her, arms crossed defensively. “Fine. Just don’t expect me to be thrilled about it.”

“Jack, please…” she sighed, her tone softening. “I know this is complicated. But we’ve been together for ten years. I thought you trusted me.” 

“Trust doesn’t erase insecurities, Em. You know that.” He paced the kitchen, the tension thick between them. 

“Jack, I love you. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be here with you. I chose you!” Her voice was firm, yet pleading.

He stopped, turning to face her. “It’s not just about love, Emily. It’s about feelings, memories, and the fact that you once shared a life with someone else. I can’t just forget that.”

Emily stepped closer, her heart pounding in her chest. “Neither can I. But I’m not going to let it ruin what we have. You’re my present and my future. I can’t lose sight of that because of a ghost from my past.” 

Jack’s gaze softened, the edge of his frustration beginning to dull. “I know. I just… I don’t want to feel like I’m competing with a memory.”

“You’re not competing with anyone, Jack. I chose you. Always.” She reached out, taking his hand and squeezing it gently.

He looked down at their intertwined fingers, the warmth of her touch calming his racing thoughts. “So, we’re doing this? We’re going to the wedding?”

“Yes! Together. We can handle this, right?” 

Jack hesitated, the weight of the situation still heavy on his shoulders, but he felt the tug of her optimism. “Together,” he echoed softly, a hint of a smile creeping onto his face.

“Good.” Emily grinned, relief flooding her features. “We might even have fun dancing. I’ll just make sure to keep you away from any toast-related mishaps.”

“Like I said, I’m a wounded gazelle. It’s a part of my charm.” 

As they shared a laugh, the air around them lightened, their earlier frustrations fading like distant echoes. But deep within, an unspoken tension lingered, a reminder of the complexities of their love.

Just then, Emily’s phone buzzed again, breaking the moment. She looked down, her eyes widening. “Oh no! Julia just sent another message. She wants to meet up for coffee to discuss wedding plans. Right now.”

“Right now?” Jack raised an eyebrow, a hint of dread creeping into his voice. “You mean I have to meet Derek’s fiancée?”

“Derek’s fiancée-to-be,” Emily corrected, her excitement bubbling to the surface. “Come on! This could be fun!”

Jack sighed dramatically, but the corners of his mouth twitched upward. “Fine, but only if I get to wear my ‘wounded gazelle’ costume.”

“Deal!” Emily laughed, grabbing her bag as they headed for the door. 

As they stepped outside into the bright, bustling world, both felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. The journey ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: they would face it together—love, hate, and everything in between.

As they reached the car, Emily turned to Jack, her expression serious again. “Just promise me one thing.”

“What’s that?”

“Promise you won’t let Derek get under your skin.” 

Jack paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. “No promises. But I’ll try.”

“Good enough,” she replied, smiling as they climbed into the car. 

With a shared look of determination, they pulled away from their home, ready to navigate the complexities of love, insecurities, and the ghosts of the past. 

But as they drove towards their friend’s café, an unexpected text buzzed on Jack’s phone—a message from an unknown number that sent a chill down his spine. 

*“I’m back in town. We need to talk.”*

The words hung in the air, an ominous echo of unresolved history that neither of them saw coming.
